                            For them - just getting by isn't enough; they want to be full of energy and vibrant. 
                            <b> Health is holistic </b> - the body's systems are interconnected and just like a spider's web,
                            when you pull on one thread, everything is affected. Better sleep, less stress, good digestion,
                            and a tailored diet are some of the ways I can help you strengthen your interconnected health.

                            Clients want to stop playing a symptom chasing Whac-A-Mole and instead get to the root of the problem.
                            Using the scientific wisdom of <b>Ayurveda</b> - a system of medicine <b>recognized by the World Health Organization</b> -
                            I help cut through all the conflicting health noise and by following your unique history, a plan is created specifically
                            tailored for you and your needs - all in a realistic, do-able way. Because life is busy enough, let's make being healthy 
                            a whole lot easier.

                            The American born, Netherlands living, former teacher who made the switch to ayurveda because feeling good makes enjoying life so much easier!
                            <br/><br/>  
                            The short version: Ayurveda helped me on my health journey feel better than I even knew was possible. Calmer in my mind, and more connected to my body.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Enthusiasm and curiosity fueled me: <i>How did this work?</i>
                            <br/><br/>
                            Before I knew it, I was back in school. Studying ayurveda for 4 years only increased my passion. Now, I get to enthusiastically share it with others as they travel their path...
